When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you want to share your code or collaborate with others on code. Also serves
    as an off-site backup of your code base.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you automatically update, there might be changes on the remote repository that
    you are not ready to integrate into your local working copy. You may have to deal
    with resolving a conflict at a time when you just want to get on with your work.
    Manually updating allows you to prepare for these issues and be in the right
    frame of mind to deal with them.
