When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you want to share your code or collaborate with others on code. Also serves
    as an off-site backup of your code base.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you automatically update, there might be changes on the remote repository that
    you are not ready to integrate into your local working copy. You may have to deal
    with resolving a conflict at a time when you just want to get on with your work.
    Manually updating allows you to prepare for these issues and be in the right
    frame of mind to deal with them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

    Forking is copying a remote repository (created by someone else) to your remote
    account. It then behaves like one of your remote repositories, but it has a link
    back to the original repository. It allows you to make tracked changes to
    somebody else's code when you don't have permission to change it.
    
    Cloning is when you copy a repository from a remote location down on to your
    local machine. The repository could belong to you or someone you are working
    with closely. You can make changes locally and push them directly to the
    remote repository.
    
    Branching is used when you want to add a new experimental feature to your code
    and you don't want to affect the stable version of the code for the time being.
    Once the experiment on the branch proves successful, the branch can be merged
    back into the stable version and the branch deleted. When you do the merge,
    there maybe some conflicts to resolve manually between the branches, though
    git will do its best to merge them automatically.
