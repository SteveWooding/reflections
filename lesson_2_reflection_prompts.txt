What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    git creates a place where the meta data of the repository will be stored
    (in .git directory).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    It is a temporary place to collect files ready for the next commit to the
    repository. It allows you to precisely control which files are to be included
    in the next commit. This is helpful if a logical change is spread over multiple
    files and should be committed together under a single commit message.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    See what files are there by doing a git status command. Check to see exactly
    what code is changing with the git diff --staged command and make sure it's
    only one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    When you want to try out adding an experimental feature to your code or create
    a different version for some purpose, e.g. a port for a different OS.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    They help in seeing the relationship between each commit and what git log
    will print out for any given branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

    You have a combined history of commits from each branch, which you can get
    to from the new combined branch. One of the branches is usually deleted, so
    its as though the two branches were merged together into one going forward.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

    If the differences are simple (like adding lines) then automatic is very
    convenient. A manual merge is required if the differences are more complex
    and a decision needs to be made in order to sort out what the true version
    of the merged file should be. This may mean some discussions with others
    before you are able to move on and complete the merge.
